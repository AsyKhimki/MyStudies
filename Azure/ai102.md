|  Plan and prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure | [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/1-introduction) | |**Azure AI Foundry** - a comprehensive platform for AI development on Microsoft Azure.|
||[What is AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)||- **Agents:** Generative AI applications that can respond to user input or assess situations autonomously, and take appropriate actions <br> - **Information extraction**: The ability to use computer vision, speech, and natural language processing to extract key information from documents, forms, images, recordings, and other kinds of content.<br> **Multi-modal models (language)** are able to handle image or speech prompts and respond by generating text, code, speech, or images|
||[Azure AI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/3-azure-ai-services)||- [List of Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services#available-azure-ai-services?azure-portal=true)<br> - **Azure AI services** a set of out-of-the-box prebuilt APIs and models that you can integrate into your applications <br> - To use Azure AI services, you create one or more Azure AI resources in an Azure subscription and implement code in client applications to consume them <br> - in most medium to large-scale development scenarios it's better to provision Azure AI services resources as part of an Azure AI Foundry project - enabling you to centralize access control and cost management, and making it easier to manage shared resources and build the next generation of generative AI apps and agents. <br> - Multi-service resource: encapsulates multiple AI services in a single Azure resource <br> **Examples** <br> - Azure AI services <br> - Azure AI Foundry <br> - Some services and models are available in only a subset of Azure regions |
||[Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/4-azure-ai-foundry)|- Azure AI Foundry projects <br> - Hub-based projects|- Azure AI Foundry is a platform for AI development on Microsoft Azure <br> - In Azure AI Foundry, you manage the resource connections, data, code, and other elements of the AI solution in projects.|
||[Developer Tools and SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/5-tools-and-sdks)|- Development tools and environments <br> - The Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension - GitHub and GitHub Copilot <br> - Programming languages, APIs, and SDKs <br> - GitHub and GitHub Copilot | - [Work with the Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/get-started-projects-vs-code) <br> [GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)|
||[Responsible AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/6-responsible-ai)|- Fairness <br> - Reliability and safety <br> - Privacy and security <br> - Inclusiveness <br> - Transparency <br> - Accountability | - Consider fairness from the beginning of the application development process; carefully reviewing training data to ensure it's representative of all potentially affected subjects, and evaluating predictive performance for subsections of your user population throughout the development lifecycle. <br> - Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.|
