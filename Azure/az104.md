However, it does support cross-region restore in a paired secondary region.</br></br> - Short-term retention can be minutes or daily </br> - Retention for weekly, monthly, or yearly backup points is referred to as Long-term retention. </br></br> Long-term  </br> - Planned (compliance requirements): If you know in advance that data is required years from the current time </br> - Unplanned (on-demand requirement): If you don't know in advance, then you can use on-demand backup with specific custom retention settings </br> - On-demand backup with custom retention: If you need to take a backup not scheduled via backup policy, then you can use an on-demand backup. </br> - retention policy defined in scheduled policy doesn't apply to on-demand backups. </br> - Azure Backup integrates with Log Analytics and provides the ability to see reports via Workbooks. </br> - provides in-built job monitoring for operations such as configuring backup, backing up, restoring, deleting backups (ideal for single vault) </br> - Backup Explorer provides an aggregated view of your entire backup estate, enabling detailed drill-down analysis and troubleshooting|

Typically, you create this type of log to receive notifications when specific changes occur on a resource within your Azure subscription. </br> - Specific operations: Applies to resources within your Azure subscription, and often has a scope with specific resources or a resource group. You use this type when you need to receive an alert that reports a change to an aspect of your subscription.  </br> - Service health events: Include notice of incidents and maintenance of target resources. </br> - activity log alerts monitor events only in the subscription where the alert was created. </br> - **List of attributes** </br> - When you create your activity log alert, you select Activity Log for the signal type. </br> - Health alert event examples: service issues, planned maintenance, health advisories, or choose all of the events. |
||[Use action groups and alert processing rules to send notifications when an alert is fired](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/incident-response-with-alerting-on-azure/7-actions-and-alert-processing-rules) | - Alert processing rules | - An action group is a collection of notification preferences and actions that are executed when the alert is fired. You can run one or more actions for each triggered alert </br> - **Action examples** </br> - Use alert processing rules to override the normal behavior of a fired alert by adding or suppressing an action group. </br> - Alert rules trigger alerts when a condition is met in your monitored resources. Alert processing rules modify the alerts as they're being fired. </br> - can apply alert processing rules to different resource scopes, from a single resource, or to an entire subscription.  </br> - can select a one-time window for this rule to apply, or you can set a recurrence such as a weekly recurrence.</br></br> can use alert processing rules to: </br> - Suppress notifications during planned maintenance windows. </br> - Implement management at scale, by specifying commonly used logic in a single rule, instead of having to set it consistently in all your alert rules. </br> - Add an action group to all alert types.|

||[Monitoring for Azure VMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/2-monitor-vm-health)|- VM monitoring layers </br> - Host VM monitoring </br> - VM host metrics </br> - Recommended alert rules </br> - Activity logs </br> - Boot diagnostics </br> - Guest OS, client workload, and application monitoring </br> - VM insights </br> - Client event log data | - Azure automatically records activity logs for all Azure resources </br></br> Azure VMs have several layers that require monitoring </br> - Host VM </br> - Guest operating system (OS): (Windows or Linux system running on it) </br> - Client workloads: workloads that run on the operating system </br> - Applications that run on the VM: business applications that depend on the VM</br></br> - VM host represents the compute, storage, and network resources that Azure allocates to the VM. </br> - Recommended alert rules are a predefined set of alert rules based on commonly monitored host metrics. </br> - can quickly enable and configure recommended alert rules when you create an Azure VM </br></br> can create diagnostic settings to send activity logs to the following destinations: </br> - Azure Monitor Logs: For more complex querying and alerting, and for longer retention up to two years.</br> - Azure Storage: For cheaper, long-term archiving.</br> - Azure Event Hubs: To forward outside of Azure.</br></br> - Boot diagnostics are host logs you can use to help troubleshoot boot issues with your VM </br> - can see screenshots from the VM's hypervisor for both Windows and Linux machines, and view the serial console log output of the VM boot sequence for Linux machines. </br> - To collect metrics and logs from guest OS and client workloads and applications, you need to install Azure Monitor Agent and set up a DCR. </br> - DCRs define what data to collect and where to send that data. </br> -  Azure Monitor Logs can store both metrics and event logs. </br> - Predefined VM insights workbooks show performance, connections, active ports, traffic, and other collected data from one or several VMs </br> - To collect other data, such as event logs, you can create a separate DCR that specifies the data you want to collect from the VM and where to send it. ||
||[Monitor VM host data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/3-exercise-create-virtual-machine)|- Create a VM and enable recommended alerts </br> - View built-in metrics graphs </br> - View the activity log </br> - View boot diagnostics|- Goal: create a Linux VM with recommended alerts and boot diagnostics enabled|
||[Use Metrics Explorer to view detailed host metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/4-view-host-metrics)|- Understand Metrics Explorer </br> - Create a metrics graph| - Scope: If you open Metrics Explorer from a VM, this field is prepopulated with the VM name. You can add more items with the same resource type (VMs) and location. </br> - Metric Namespace: Most resource types have only one namespace, but for some types, you must pick a namespace.|
||[Collect client performance counters by using VM insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/5-enable-vm-insights)| - Enable VM insights </br> - View VM insights| - monitor the software and processes running on your VM. These are called the VM guest or client </br> - The VM client includes the operating system and other workloads and applications.  </br> - To monitor the software running on your VM, you install the Azure Monitor Agent, which collects data from inside the VM. VM insights </br> - VM insights creates a DCR that sends client VM performance counters to Azure Monitor Logs. Because the DCR sends its metrics to Azure Monitor Logs, you don't use Metrics Explorer to view the metrics data that VM insights collects </br> - the map visualizes the VM's dependencies by discovering running process groups and processes that have active network connections over a specified time range.|
||[Collect VM client event logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/6-collect-log-data)|- Create a DCR to collect log data </br> - Create a Data Collection Endpoint </br> - Create the Data Collection Rule </br> - View log data| - **Goal:** set up a DCR to collect Linux VM Syslog data, and view the log data in Azure Monitor Log Analytics by using a simple Kusto Query Language (KQL) query. </br> - VM insights installs the Azure Monitor Agent, and creates a DCR that collects predefined performance counters, maps process dependencies, and presents the data in prebuilt workbooks. </br> - You can associate a single DCR to any or all VMs in your subscription, but you might need multiple DCRs to collect different types of data from different VMs. </br> - You must have a data collection endpoint to send log data to. |
